			<h1>PROMISES:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><span><h2>IMPROVING TECHNOLOGY</h2></span>
					<p>We have some amazing technology at our disposal, like Moodle and Daymap. However, they're cluttered, messy, and frustrating to use. </p>
					<p>As prefect, I'll gather and use student feedback to improve them, meaning they will be able to integrate seamlessly into our learning.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h2>FUN PROGRAM X!</h2>
					<p>Yes, it's possible!</p>
					<p>Let's face it, Program X can get a little boring, especially in senior years. Even though you might not like to admit it, it can be fun and a time grow as a homegroup or year level.</p>
					<p>There are times when everyone's involved in what they're doing, and having a great time. So, why can't that happen more often? </p>
				</li>
				<li><h2>BETTER COMMUNICATION</h2>
					<p>As students, we should be aware and involved in decisions that affect us.</p>
					<p>I think it should be everyone's right, in a leadership position or not, to contribute to choices concerning them. I'll ensure that everyone and anyone can make suggestions and further help in any decision making process.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h2>MORE EVENTS</h2>
					<p>Events such as Wellbeing Week, when clubs get opportunities to show off what they're about and recruit some new members, and when the whole school has a chance to get involved, really are great. They should happen more often, even if it's just a couple of clubs getting together in the Rod Pike area. </p>
				</li>

			<p>Hi, I'm David, and I'm running for Prefect. On Friday 27th, you'll vote for the candidates that you think will be the best for our school.</p>
			<p>I'm making it clear what aspects of school life I want to change, so please, vote for David! Hover over each promise to find out more! (It might not work on your phone, sorry)</p>
			<p>Thank you!</p>
