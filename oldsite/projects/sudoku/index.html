			<p>Solving this arithmetically would be a nightmare, however it can eaisly be done using Python, and a bit of code. I have no clue how many numbers we must need, but I am guessing that their position is very important.

			<p>Now on to the interesting part: how we plan on solving the problem. It should be fairly straightforward, using Peter Norvig's sudoku solver. We will create a function that produces random sudoku grids with x amount of numbers populating them. If the solver fails, we can safely increase the number to x+1, and try again. Eventually we will reach a number where the solver works, in which case we need to be more careful in our testing of the position of the numbers. We also ought to double check different configurations of x-1.
			<p>Things to watch for: requiring different types of numbers, e.g. must have a varity of digits, not just say 1s, 3s and 5s.
